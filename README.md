# enriched-Vulnerability-DataBase (eVDB)

The enriched Vulnerability DataBase (eVDB) component of the Cyber-Trust platform.

Within the framework of the work carried out for the eVDB component in Cyber-Trust, the version of MISP that was used is MISP v2.4.138.

## Why we choose MISP

The requirements that need to be met by the sharing platform of choice, first, demand from the selected platform to allow CTI sharing between the platform and different stakeholders, along with the end-user’s devices. Next, the sharing mechanism and platform should be expressible, flexible, scalable, and open source. Moreover, it should allow storing information about the source of CTI. Furthermore, it should facilitate automation and provide CTI in both human and machine-readable formats. Finally, it should support information filtering and alerting functionalities. Regarding these aspects, we concluded that Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP), is the most suitable platform to act as the project's eVDB.

MISP is an open source threat intelligence and open standard for threat information sharing platform, which is able to store and share technical and non-technical information about malware samples, incidents, attackers and intelligence. Specifically, MISP provides a user interface (UI), which enables users to create, search or share events amongst other MISP users or communities. Furthermore, all CTI stored in the MISP database can be accessed through an API, which allows for data exporting in a wide variety of formats, such as XML, JSON, OpenIOC, STIX, and more. 

Additionally, MISP has an automatic correlation mechanism that is able to identify relationships between attributes, objects and indicators from malware correlation engines. Moreover, MISP stores data in a structured format, provides extensive support of cyber-security indicators for different vertical sectors, and 
supports CTI sharing for both human and machine applications. More details about MISP functionalities are described in https://github.com/MISP/MISP.
 
Intelligence vocabularies (MISP galaxy) can be bundled with existing threat adversaries, malware and ransomware or linked to events from MITRE ATT&CK, which is a publicly available knowledge base, that contains adversary tactics and techniques based on real observations. Communities can leverage MITRE ATT&CK, in order to develop specific threat models and methodologies for Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). 

Finally, MISP provides a flexible free text import tool to facilitate the integration of unstructured reports into MISP and an adjustable taxonomy to classify and tag events according to the users’ own classification schemes and taxonomies.
